## An example of a portfolio site for a photographer and web designer.

This site was created during the HTML and CSS course: "The Modern Flexbox, Grid, Sass & Animations Developer Course"

#### Changes I made to the code:

- Using the correct BEM structure
- Compressing all images, change some images
- Center alignment of content where needed

I have not changed the image format to a lighter one. Also, the images are not optimized for use on both computers and mobile devices.

Also, all files are not compressed into one line, and the DRY principle is not used in many places in the code. There are many errors that can be corrected.

But since this is only an educational project, and not my personal one, I left many things "as is".
